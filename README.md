# Marine-Mineral-Exploration
This repository contains the materials and analysis conducted for the case study on Marine Mineral Exploration, focusing on sulfide ore deposits and hydrothermal venting systems in marine environments.

## Project Overview
Mineral resources on land are increasingly being exhausted, pushing the boundaries of exploration into marine environments. This project investigates the Iheya Minor Ridge in the Okinawa Trough, a region known for its rich sulfide ore deposits. The primary goal is to analyze the geophysical data collected from Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to identify potential mineralization sites using the Self Potential (SP) method.

## Key Objectives
+ Geological Study: Understanding the geology and metalliferous ore bodies at the Iheya Minor Ridge.
+ Data Collection: Gathering high-resolution electric field data using AUVs.
+ Data Processing: Analyzing and processing the data to identify SP anomalies.
+ Data Interpretation: Linking SP anomalies to hydrothermal venting as a potential indicator of seafloor mineralization.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
Data were collected during a 9.5-hour dive of the AUV, covering 20 lines, each approximately 1 km long. The AUV maintained a target altitude of 70 meters, with a speed of 1.1 m/s. Electric field data were sampled at 250 Hz, synchronized to GPS time.

2. Data Processing
The electric field data were processed by averaging 30-second windows and merging with AUV navigation data. Standard errors were calculated to account for spatial variations in the electric field.

3. Data Interpretation
The processed data were interpreted to identify negative SP anomalies. These anomalies are indicative of hydrothermal fluid emissions, which are associated with potential sulfide ore mineralization on the seafloor.

## Results
Successfully mapped electric fields over a 1 km Ã— 1 km area with high repeatability.
Identified negative SP anomalies, suggesting hydrothermal venting as a key factor in seafloor mineralization.

## Conclusion
The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using AUVs combined with the SP method for marine mineral exploration. The identified SP anomalies correlate with known hydrothermal venting areas, making this approach viable for future exploration activities.
